# LPS

LPS is a user friendly mathematical tool for solving linear programming problems exclusively for feasible solutions. The program implements the simplex algorithm using the numpy module to handle matrices to build the backbone of the solver. The main algorithm is based on the standard form, (maximization problem), and the duality of simplex is used to optimize minization problems. The algorithm does not handle infeasible and infinite solutions.

## Demonstration

Let's try to solve this feasible linear programming problem, [Two Mines Problem](http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/or/basicor.html#twomines). The problem states:

> The Two Mines Company own two different mines that produce an ore which, after being crushed, is graded into three classes: high, medium and low-grade. The company has contracted to provide a smelting plant with 12 tons of high-grade, 8 tons of medium-grade and 24 tons of low-grade ore per week. The two mines have different operating characteristics as detailed below.

| Mine | Cost per day (Â£'000) | Production (tons/day) |        |     |
| ---- | -------------------- | --------------------- | ------ | --- |
|      |                      | High                  | Medium | Low |
| x    | 180                  | 6                     | 3      | 4   |
| y    | 160                  | 1                     | 1      | 6   |

> How many days per week should each mine be operated to fulfil the smelting plant contract?
